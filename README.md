# DolphinBisectTool
Windows utility to automate the bisection process for issues in the Dolphin Emulator. This is an unofficial utility not endorsed by the Dolphin Emulator project. Do not file any bugs on the Dolphin Emulator bug tracker. Please file all issues for the utility here on Github.

# Requirements
Dolphin Bisect Tool requires .NET 4.0 framework to run.

To compile, Dolphin Bisect Tool was written and compiled in Visual Studio 2015. 2013 supposedly works, but is not tested. Due to the crappy 7zip library I used, set your build settings to create a x86 build. I intend to use a better library in the future.

# Contributing
Code clean ups, features, bug fixes, or anything else are greatly welcome. Just make a pull request. I would appreciate it if Dolphin's [contribution guidelines] (https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin/blob/master/Contributing.md) were followed.

# Contact
Dolphin Bisect Tool was written by Anthony 'Helios' Serna.
